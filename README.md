This current state of SilkyMills.com is serving host to a restaurant-idea brainstormed by two high-school friends.
It is a basic restaurant website utilizing lightbox coding for menu preview, JavaScript datepicker build, and form submission for a basic reservation application.  
There is nothing extraordinary that a user needs to do before loading the site as what script is built utilizes web links along with original, source coding
-just Open index.html and enjoy!
